# What’s a JS development environment?

As a beginner, whenever you start a new project, you only think of your current needs, and you always start from scratch when creating your files.

Web devs look at the big picture and analyze the current and future needs of their project before writing a single line of code. Based on that, 
they choose tools and libraries that will help them code faster and avoid repetitive, manual tasks.

Then, they build the core folder structure, install all the dependencies and configure the tools to perform the desired actions. All this preparatory work takes time, 
so in order to avoid going through the same project again and again, developers use boilerplates or starter kits.

These are _“pre-made”_ packages that include the minimum amount of files and dependencies needed for a front end project, regardless of what you’re building.

So in this tutorial we’ll go through the entire process of creating a front end starter kit (a JavaScript development environment), and I’ll explain the why 
and how of every step. At the end of the course, you should be able to set up your own JS dev environment and deploy your first project to production.

As this is a super long tutorial, I encourage you to bookmark it and keep it as reference.
